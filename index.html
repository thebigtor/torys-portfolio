        <hr>
        <p>My technical background includes extensive Python, HTML, as well as CSS, and I’m currently expanding my skills with 
            JavaScript and various other frameworks. I enjoy exploring new technologies to broaden my expertise and 
            stay up to date with the latest trends. I’m pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of 
            Northern Iowa while competing as a thrower on the Track and Field team. My dedication allows me to 
            excel in both academic and athletic pursuits. Feel free to reach out with any questions or 
            collaboration ideas — and be sure to check out my projects below!</p>

            <img class="project-image" src="mp_menu.png" alt="myPass Main Menu Screenshot">
            <p><i>As my most recent Python project to date, I developed a password manager application that stores and manages user passwords. You can add and remove passwords and
                services to customize your expericence directly to you. I built this using Python and the Tkinter library for the GUI.</i>

            <p><i>The Well is a local hangout website I developed using HTML, CSS, 
                and was my first website. It features a user-friendly interface and allows users 
                to find and share local events and activities. I feel this project shows how
                even when starting from scratch, I can create something valuable and engaging. you
